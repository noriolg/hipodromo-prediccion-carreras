# Hipódromo

The aim of this side project is to build a model that can help predict the winning horse for races in Hipódromo de la Zarzuela (Madrid). 
This is a long term project and it is not sure that the results will be satisfactory.

For now, the data gathering and scraping process is still undergoing. I currently have no clue on how to proceed one I have enough data so I will be doing some more research on the topic. 

Some doubts I have are:
* When bilding the model, horses in your race matter a lot so somehow it would be necessary to individually consider each race.
* How to account fot the other horses in the same race when training the model?
* Any other factors that influence?

Planned next steps:
* Find more information about the trainer/owner of the horse and substitute that info for their name in the tables.
* Map weather to each of the races
